# Testing Project: Test-Driven Development

**Objectives:**

- to learn test-driven development techniques
- to think abstractly about how a piece of software might be implemented
- to gain experience with class invariants and method pre- and post-conditions
- to practice writing good tests
- to get experience using JUnit framework, including the strengths and limitations of unit testing
- to collaborate with a partner using Git
- to help you become a good, systematic tester!


## Overview

Using JUnit, write test cases for the Car class. Put your tests in a separate package called tests. Since you do not have code for the Car class, you will have to imagine what that code might look like to write good tests. You might find it useful to write code for the Car class if you are having trouble imagining what the code might look like.

**Goal:** Create a set of good test cases that are likely to find errors in the code. Specifically, you want to be able to reveal the faults in my code. We've been talking about what it means for a test case and/or a set of test cases to be good, e.g., you want to automate the test case, cover all of the code/functionality and you want to test boundary cases, etc.

_ I'm not giving you the actual code because I don't want you to simply debug my code and write test cases that find those bugs. I want you to write test cases that will reveal ANY and ALL faults in the code._

Enjoy the challenge! How often does a professor ask the students to find and expose their faults?? :)
